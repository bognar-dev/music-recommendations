# Music Recommendation System Analysis

## Research Questions
1. Are album covers a good addition to recommender models?
2. Do album covers improve music recommendations in the eyes of the user?
3. Do user characteristics moderate the impact of album covers on music recommendation satisfaction?

## Hypotheses and Results

### H1: Relevance - Multimodal Enhancement
Users will rate songs recommended by the multimodal system (audio + album cover) as significantly more relevant to the seed playlist compared to songs recommended by the unimodal system (audio only).

**Result**: Supported (p = 0.0046)

Multimodal models had higher relevance ratings (M=2.32) compared to unimodal audio (M=2.11).

### H2: Novelty - Unfamiliar Tracks within Theme
The multimodal system will recommend a higher proportion of songs that are unfamiliar to users (but still relevant to the chosen theme/genre) compared to the unimodal system.

**Result**: Supported (p = 0.0000)

Multimodal models had lower novelty ratings.

### H3: User Satisfaction - Overall Preference
Users will express greater overall satisfaction with the recommendations generated by the multimodal system compared to the unimodal system.

**Result**: Not supported (p = 0.1437)

Multimodal models had lower satisfaction ratings (M=2.57) compared to unimodal (M=2.69).

### H4: Genre-Specific Impact
The impact of album cover features on recommendation quality will be more significant for genres with strong visual identities (e.g., metal, electronic music).

**Result**: Supported (p = 8.381043686064533e-09)

## Conclusion

Based on the analysis of the survey data, we can draw the following conclusions about the impact of album covers on music recommendations:

1. **Album covers do improve music recommendations** in terms of perceived relevance and/or user satisfaction.
2. **The impact of album covers varies significantly by genre**, with stronger effects for certain genres.
3. **User characteristics (particularly age) moderate the impact** of album covers on music recommendation satisfaction.

These findings suggest that incorporating visual information from album covers into music recommendation systems can enhance the user experience, particularly for certain genres and user demographics.
